                Ministering Hand Incorporated is a nonprofit organization
                dedicated to supporting women undergoing cancer treatment within
                the Duke and UNC Healthcare system by providing safe housing and
                transportation assistance throughout the course of treatment.
                Our services include safe, temporary housing tailored to each
                patient's treatment duration and the provision of simple,
                nutritious meals. Built on a strong foundation of experience and
                connection within the North Carolina cancer care community,
                Ministering Hand Incorporated is committed to providing referral
                services and resources to alleviate patientsâ€™ emotional,
                financial, counseling and social support needs. Focused on women
                facing financial hardship, distance from care, and lack of
                support, we strive to offer a nurturing environment to ease the
                non-medical burdens of cancer so patients can focus fully on
                healing. In time, we plan to expand our services to include male
                patients and broader healthcare networks. By addressing barriers
                to healthcare, we strive to ensure that no woman fights cancer
                alone.

              <p>
                With over two decades of experience in oncology patient care,
                Ms. Pearl Langhorne brings deep compassion, firsthand insight,
                and unwavering dedication to her role as the founder of
                Ministering Hand Incorporated.
              </p>
              <p>
                For 21 years, Pearl served as a manager at the UNC Cancer
                Center, where she worked closely with women battling cancer and
                witnessed the many obstacles they face, from emotional distress
                to financial hardship and housing insecurity.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moved by the recurring stories of women traveling long distances
                alone, navigating treatment without support, or struggling to
                afford basic needs, Ms. Langhorne was inspired to act. She
                founded Ministering Hand with a singular goal: to create a safe,
                supportive, and dignified space for women undergoing cancer
                treatment, particularly those lacking family support, stable
                income, or proximity to care.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ms. Langhorne's leadership is grounded in both professional
                expertise and personal empathy, enabling her to build a
                mission-driven organization rooted in healing, hope, and
                holistic care.
